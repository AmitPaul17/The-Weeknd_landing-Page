            <h2>Recent Album</h2>
            <p><span>After Hours </span> is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer The Weeknd. The album was released on March 20, 2020, by XO and Republic Records. The album was produced primarily by The Weeknd, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as DaHeala, Illangelo, and Metro Boomin, all of whom The Weeknd had worked with previously. The standard edition has no features, although the remixes edition contains guest appearances from Chromatics and Lil Uzi Vert. Music journalists have noted the album as an artistic reinvention for The Weeknd, with the introduction of new wave and dream pop influences, while thematically, After Hours explores promiscuity, overindulgence, and self-loathing.</p>
